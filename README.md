The Weather App is a web application that provides users with real-time weather information based on their location. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface and integrates with a weather API to fetch and display weather data.

Features:
#Location-based Weather: The app automatically detects the user's location (with their permission) and fetches the current weather conditions for that location.

#Detailed Weather Information: Users can view detailed weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

#Search Functionality: Users can also search for weather information of specific locations by entering the city name.

#Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Used for structuring the webpage and its content.
CSS: Employed for styling the interface and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Utilized for fetching data from the weather API, handling user interactions, and updating the interface dynamically.
API Integration: Integrated with a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack) to retrieve weather data based on user requests.
